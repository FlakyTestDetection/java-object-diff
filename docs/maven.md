In order to use java-object-diff with Maven, all you need to do is to add this dependency to your POM:

	<dependency>
		<groupId>de.danielbechler</groupId>
		<artifactId>java-object-diff</artifactId>
		<version>0.95</version>
	</dependency>

That's it! Now you're ready to go!

## Dependency not found?

It can take up to 2 hours after the release of a new version until it is actually mirrored to the Maven Central repository. So if it isn't available right away, please try again a few hours later. If after a couple of hours it's still not available, feel free to report the issue, so I can investigate.
